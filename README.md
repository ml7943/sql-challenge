This is the assignment for module 9.

The folder "EmployeeSQL" consists of four parts in total. 

The "main.sql" file is the main code section that needs to be executed. 

There is a "data" folder containing six CSV files. After running the "create table" section, you need to import these six files into their corresponding tables. 

The other two files are named EDR, which stand for Entity-Relationship Diagram. They include an EDR image and a text file.
